# Rapid Order

For our final project we, a team of 4, developed an order and payment mobile first app 📱, that allows customers of bars and restaurants to check the menu and place an order directly 🍻🍝, without having to wait for the waiter to come. This was all done without having to create an account or sign up, just scanning a QR-code suffices. Rapid Order is built on Ruby on Rails, using the MVC approach. Front end is done using HTML, Sass and Bootstrap and the functionality was done using JS6 and the Stimulus framework.
